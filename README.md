# ThinkTank Consulting LLC

Imagine a small hand picked global diverse team of highly intelligent and communication compatible STEM experts with 1 or 2 cyber engineers driving automation, AI, and machine learning while they volunteer their time to consult on a variety of global issues decided on by the global Populus. Here's the kicker though, everyone on the team isn't just a STEM expert....they are a STEM expert with an absolute passion and heart for helping others and do it solely out of gratitude and self-actualization.
